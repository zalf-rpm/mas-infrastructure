<h1>How to Use Monica Interface</h1>


<div>

    <p>
        To use Monica service you need to have at least 4 files with
        these names: Sim.json Site.json, Crop.json, and Climate.csv.  You may also need
        a few JSON files as parameters.
    </p>

    <p>
        Since this web interface does not have access to users’
        local directories, you need to upload your Sim, Site, Crop and Climate files
        into the program, and if there is any link to the parameters, those JSON parameter
        files should be accessible in your github repository. So the program can read
        them from your github repository.
    </p>

    <p>
        Note: You can also use this program if any of these files
        are missing (we will use some default data), but remember; this case is only
        for testing purposes (e.g. for students).
    </p>

    <p><b>Login to your github</b></p>

    <p>
        You can find the login box on the top right of the Home page.
        You will be redirected to the Github login page to enter your Github User name and Password. If you are already logged into your Github on the same browser,
        and this is not your first login, you may not even asked to enter your data.
    </p>
    <p>Monica App needs to access to your public github repository to read the Monica parameters or to commit you result,
    so you need to permit Github to let Monica App has this access, if you are asked on the login page.</p>

    </p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
        If you don’t log in to your github, you can
        still use this program, but some features will not be available/visable.
    </p>

    <p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><b>Upload Data:</b></p>

    <p>
        Use this page to upload your Sim, Site, Crop,
        and climate files. (sim, site and crop files are in JSON format and the climate
        file is in CSV format).
    </p>

    <p>
        <img width=751 height=532 id="Picture 3"
             src="help/image002.jpg">
    </p>

    <p>
        Be careful that the name of the files must
        correctly start with (sim/site/crop or climate). Please note that if you upload
        two or more files with the same structure (e.g. two sim files), the system will
        ignore the second one and you may confuse which file has been used to make the
        result.
    </p>

    <p>
        Please note that if you don’t upload one of
        these files, the system will ask you a confirmation and then you need to
        approve that a sample file will be used instead of the missing file. (We
        activated these default values only for educational purposes).
    </p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
        If you are logged into your github, you
        will have some options at the bottom of this page.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            Read Monica parameters from the Default
            server:
        </b> will read the parameters form sample data if it is mentioned in
        your sim/site/crop file.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Read Monica parameters from your github</b>:
        will show you a box to enter your parameters path in your github repository.
        You can copy the path from your browser when you are in your github. Please see
        the image blew
    </p>

    <p>
        <img width=752 height=538
             src="help/image003.jpg">
    </p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
        Please note that this app will ignore the “include-file-base-path”
        option inside your sim/crop/site and will use the path which is defined here in
        this page. This is especially notable for old Monica users who needed to set the
        path of the parameters inside the main files.
    </p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
        When you send your request to the Monica
        ZMQ server, the app needs some time to read and merge your data, send it to the
        simulator and show the result to you. If your files are big or you have many
        parameters, reading from your local machine or github is not real-time and
        takes a little bit of time. So after click on the "Send" button please be patient.
    </p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
        This app can also provide the results in
        two ways for you.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Show me a download link:</b> your result
        will be saved on our server for a few days. You can download the results in
        JSON and CSV format or you can copy the link and share it with other people. So
        others just need to have this unique link to see your result. We recommend you
        to download your result if you need it for further use, because depending on
        the server load, old results will be deleted time by time.
    </p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
        <b>Export into my github</b>: This option
        will ask you a path to your github to put/commit your results there. We suggest
        you to use the same path as your parameters on your github.
    </p>

    <p>
        Please note that the path is absolute and
        doesn’t have “/” at its end.
    </p>

    <p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><b>Results’ chart</b></p>

    <p>
        On this page you have three options to load
        your results on a chart.
    </p>

    <p>
        <img width=753 height=395 id="Picture 1"
             src="help/image004.jpg">
    </p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
        If you are logged in, and you have entered
        a right path in
    </p>

    <p>
        Upload Data <span style='font-family:Wingdings'>à</span>
        Result Options <span style='font-family:Wingdings'>à</span> Export it into my
        github<span style='font-family:Wingdings'>à</span> github Path
    </p>

    <p>
        And you have some results inside this
        directory in your repository, then you can select your result among them.
    </p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
        <img width=753 height=395 id="Picture 2"
             src="help/image005.jpg">
    </p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
        By selecting one, the system will read your
        JSON result from your repository and will show you an option to choose your
        Chart Group
    </p>

    <p>
        <img width=753 height=433 id="Picture 4"
             src="help/image006.jpg">
    </p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
        If your result is valid, depending on your
        result, you will have a few groups to choose from. After selecting one, you will
        be asked to choose the right x Axis.
    </p>

    <p>
        <img width=753 height=433 id="Picture 5"
             src="help/image007.jpg">
    </p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
        When the app draws the chart, by default,
        the first item is enabled as y Axis.
    </p>

    <p>
        <img width=751 height=454 id="Picture 6"
             src="help/image008.jpg">
    </p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
        You can enable or disable different items
        by clicking on the name. (The list is placed at the right side of the chart)
    </p>

    <p>
        <img width=752 height=518 id="Picture 7"
             src="help/image009.jpg">
    </p>

    <p>
        If you want to zoom in; on the chart, you
        can just click, hold the button and drag your mouse to the new area, then
        release it to see the result in detail.
    </p>

    <p>

             src="help/image010.gif">
    </p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
        There are also some options to export the
        chart as an image by clicking on the three horizontal lines at the top right of
        the chart.
    </p>

    <p>
        <img width=752 height=489 id="Picture 8"

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><b>View result from shared link:</b></p>

    <p>
        This option lets you paste your result link
        to see its chart. If someone shares a link to you, you need to enter that link
        here to see the chart.
    </p>

    <p>
        Please note that this is a link to a JSON
        file, so CSV links will not work here.
    </p>

    </p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><b>Upload Monica result file:</b></p>

    <p>
        If you have saved your result before, you
        can drop it anytime here to see it on a chart. Old results (only in JSON format)
        should also work fine.
    </p>

    <p>
        Setting page contains very important information
        about the Monica ZMQ server. You need to ask about the right configuration
        before using this program. There are probably some default settings here, but
        you need to be sure these are addressing a right Monica ZMQ server.
    </p>

    <p>
        To change a setting you just need to
        replace the default value. (There is no save button, it will be saved
        automatically.)
    </p>

    <p>
        If you have logged into your github
        account, you may see your repository name in the “User Name” field.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Github Path Validator:</b> is a tool, to
        check whether the app has access to read your parameters correctly or not. (Use
        this tool when you are logged-in.)
    </p>

    <p>
        If you enter a right path; by clicking on
        the “Validate the path” button, a green checkmark icon will be shown.
    </p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
        If you are logged-in, your setting form the
        setting page and your github paths (parameters and export path) will be saved
        on your browser’s local storage, so next time you use this service you don’t
        need to fill these fields again, but if you use a different browser, you need
        to log-in again. In this case, you can save different settings (by the same or a
        different github user) it also means that you cannot reach your previous
        settings by logging-in from different browsers. But in the same browser your
        setting will remain valid even after closing the browser. If you want to clear
        the setting you need to logout.
